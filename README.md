# Solidity-Blocktimestamp-converter
 ## Overview
The TimestampConverter contract is a Solidity smart contract that provides a comprehensive solution for converting UNIX timestamps to human-readable date and time representations. It offers functions to retrieve the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second components from a given timestamp.

This contract can be utilized in various Ethereum-based applications and smart contracts that require timestamp conversions for displaying or manipulating dates and times.

#### Features
Conversion of UNIX timestamp to a human-readable date and time representation.
Retrieval of year, month, day, hour, minute, and second components from a timestamp.

#### Prerequisites
To use the TimestampConverter contract, you need the following:

A compatible development environment such as Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.
Access to an Ethereum network (local development network or testnet) for deploying and interacting with the contract.

#### Deployment
Open your preferred development environment and create a new Solidity contract file.

Copy the contents of the TimestampConverter contract into your contract file.

Compile and deploy the contract to your Ethereum network of choice.

__Usage__
To utilize the TimestampConverter contract, follow these steps:

Obtain the deployed contract instance address after successful deployment.

Interact with the contract by calling its functions.

#### Converting Timestamp
To convert a UNIX timestamp to a human-readable date and time representation, use the __convertTimestamp__ function.

```shell
function convertTimestamp(uint256 timestamp) public view returns (string memory)
```
__Parameters:__

timestamp: The UNIX timestamp to be converted.
__Return Value:__

A string representing the corresponding date and time in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".
Retrieving Time Components
The TimestampConverter contract provides individual functions to retrieve specific time components from a given timestamp.

getYear: Retrieves the year component from a timestamp.

getMonth: Retrieves the month component from a timestamp.

getDay: Retrieves the day component from a timestamp.

getHour: Retrieves the hour component from a timestamp.

getMinute: Retrieves the minute component from a timestamp.

getSecond: Retrieves the second component from a timestamp.

```shell
function getYear(uint256 timestamp) public view returns (uint16)
function getMonth(uint256 timestamp) public view returns (uint8)
function getDay(uint256 timestamp) public view returns (uint8)
function getHour(uint256 timestamp) public view returns (uint8)
function getMinute(uint256 timestamp) public view returns (uint8)
function getSecond(uint256 timestamp) public view returns (uint8)
```
__Parameter:__

timestamp: The UNIX timestamp from which to extract the time component.
__Return Value:__

The respective time component extracted from the timestamp.


#### Examples
Here are a few examples of how to use the TimestampConverter contract:

```shell
TimestampConverter public converter;

constructor() {
    // Deploy the TimestampConverter contract
    converter = new TimestampConverter();
}

function getDateTime(uint256 timestamp) public view returns (string memory) {
    // Call the convertTimestamp function of the TimestampConverter contract
    return converter.convertTimestamp(timestamp);
}
```
In the above example, the getDateTime function in the MyContract contract retrieves the date and time representation of a given timestamp by calling the convertTimestamp function of the TimestampConverter contract.
